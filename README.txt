This is the chord shape generator.

The idea is that the user can choose a rood and a chord and it will find the shape on the fretboard.

What works:
Everything works. The shapes are limited to realistic finger distances and permutations of a chord.
There are a few quirky things too, but otherwise the user can choose a root note, a chord quality, click on find shape and
the shape will show up in red on the fretboard.
You can click on the previous or next button to see the next shape. There are still duplicates and some shapes will not load
due to the parameters, so if you use it, you might encounter a shape that won't work.
I have it to where the options selected reset after the find shape button is clicked but the name remains to show what the shape in red 
shows. The name will change automatically as the user chooses another root/quality. It is important to note that you will currently see
some repeated shapes just because it looks for these chords starting from the 6th string.

Things to add:
Being able to go through different shapes without the risk of a never ending script.
Shapes that start on all other strings.
Find all shapes, not just the permutations

This app will be added into the AAMT website in order to prevent me from having to create tons of images for showing chord shapes.
