This is the chord shape generator.

The idea is that the user can choose a chord and it will find the shape on the fretboard.

It is a work in progress.
I have the fretboard working, I have the finding mechanic working but not as well as I would like.
I hope that I can get it to find a new shape everytime the user hits the next button.

This app will be added into the AAMT website in order to prevent me from having to create tons of images for showing chord shapes.
