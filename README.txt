This is the chord shape generator.

The idea is that the user can choose a rood and a chord and it will find the shape on the fretboard.

What works:
Everything should work, but you will be limited to only one shape. There are a few quirky things too, but otherwise the user can choose
a root note, a chord quality, click on find shape and the shape will show up in red on the fretboard.
I have to where the options selected reset after the find shape button is clicked but the name remains to show what the shape in red 
shows. The name will change automatically as the user chooses another root/quality.

Things to add:
Being able to go through different shapes.
Setting up parameters so that it doesn't show unrealistic shapes.
Showing inversions.

This app will be added into the AAMT website in order to prevent me from having to create tons of images for showing chord shapes.
