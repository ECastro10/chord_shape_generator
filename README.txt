This is the chord shape generator.

The idea is that the user can choose a rood and a chord and it will find the shape on the fretboard.

What works:
Everything but the previous button works. The shapes are limited to realistic finger distances and permutations of a chord.
There are a few quirky things too, but otherwise the user can choose
a root note, a chord quality, click on find shape and the shape will show up in red on the fretboard.
You can also click on the next button, but it stops working due to the way I have the code structured.
I have to where the options selected reset after the find shape button is clicked but the name remains to show what the shape in red 
shows. The name will change automatically as the user chooses another root/quality. It is important to note that you will currently see
some repeated shapes just because it looks for these chords starting from the 6th string.

Things to add:
Being able to go through different shapes.
Shapes that start on all other strings.
Ability to revisit same shapes (i.e. using the previous button successfully).
Find all shapes, not just the permutations

This app will be added into the AAMT website in order to prevent me from having to create tons of images for showing chord shapes.
